* Simply put, I really like Haskell's solution to effects, i.e. monads. I know
  that some people hate them, and some people feel that they are unnecessary,
  but I really enjoy writing code with them. And this is my language, after
  all.

* I'm pretty sure that I'll be able to manage effects in a pure systems language
  with monads, but I won't know until I try. I know it's possible in a language
  like Habit, but the type system I have in mind for PureBit is a lot more
  complicated.
