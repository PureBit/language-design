* I will be using colon-equals notation for top-level declarations, e.g.

```PureBit
f: X -> X
f := x + x
```

I will have to track down the history of this syntax. That being said, I've seen it all over the place, mostly in papers on the Lambda calculus.

For now, I am using it in this way because that's how Spivak uses it in his book _Category Theory for the Sciences_.
