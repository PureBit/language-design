Types
-----

* Separate type declaration from function declaration.

* Use category theory syntax for type declarations.

E.G.
```PureBit
f: x -> x
f x = x + x
```

That is, type declaration uses `:` instead of Haskell's `::`.

Also, it uses Haskell's `->` operator to denote mapping from one type to another.
