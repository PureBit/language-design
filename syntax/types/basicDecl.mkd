* Separate type declaration from function declaration (like Haskell).

* Use category theory syntax for type declarations.

* Types are capitalized (functions & objects are lower-case).

E.G.
```PureBit
f: X -> X
f x := x + x
```

That is, type declaration uses `:` instead of Haskell's `::`.

Also, it uses the set theory syntax of the `->` operator to denote mapping from
one type to another. This is the same as Haskell.

~~However, when objects map to other other objects, the `|->` operator is used
instead.~~
I think that the `:->` operator is better. And when an object is mapped in
reverse, I will use the `<-:` operator. Though `|->` and `<-|` is closer to the
map operator in math, i.e. `â†¦`, using the UTF8 is just not practical, and the
ASCII equivalents are not very good. Hence, the alternatives.

* N.B. The above uses some kind of typed Lambda calculus notation. Since I plan
  on using dependent types, the above example only showcases some of the syntax,
  and is not representative. When I work out the DT syntax & semantics, I'll
  update the example.
