* Separate type declaration from function declaration (like Haskell).

* Use category theory syntax for type declarations.

E.G.
```PureBit
f: x -> x
f x = x + x
```

That is, type declaration uses `:` instead of Haskell's `::`.

Also, it uses the set theory syntax of the `->` operator to denote mapping from one type to another. This is the same as Haskell.
