* I like SuccessorML's commenting syntax. Namely:

```
  Comments     = Blockcomment
               | Linecomment
  Blockcomment = Startcomment Block Endcomment
  Startcomment = (*
  Block        = Expression
               | Module
               | Declaration
               | Comments                      (comments can be nested)
  Endcomment   = *)
  Linecomment  = (*)
```
